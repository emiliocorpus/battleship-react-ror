== Battleship on React.js

This application is built on Ruby on Rails and React.js. It is modeled after the original Battleship game while at the same time constructed to understand how to implement a single page application. This was one of the first React.js programs I have built and serves my foundation into experiencing React.js. Very fun (and frustrating) to build, the application allowed me to experience the flow of constructing a React.js / RoR application.
